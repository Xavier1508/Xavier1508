### A Little More About Me...

I’m a Computer Science student and Cyber Security enthusiast who enjoys turning big ideas into something real, whether it’s building an app, experimenting with AI, or breaking down security systems (the ethical way, of course 😎).
For me, coding isn’t just about solving problems, it’s like a puzzle game that I never get tired of playing. I love the challenge of making things simple, useful, and maybe a little fun along the way.
When I’m not behind the keyboard, you’ll probably find me exploring new ideas, designing something, or just running to clear my head (yes, literally running 🏃).

### What I'm Up To Right Now

* Building: A project that blends machine learning with real-world impact, predicting chronic kidney disease using AI models.
* Learning: Diving deeper into cyber security, zero trust architecture, and advanced ML techniques.
* Collaborating: Open to working on AI/ML and security-related projects, especially those that involve creative problem-solving.
* Creating: Experimenting with UI/UX design and finding new ways to make tech not just functional, but also enjoyable to use.

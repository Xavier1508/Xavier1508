### A Little More About Me...

Iâ€™m a Computer Science student and Cyber Security enthusiast who enjoys turning big ideas into something real, whether itâ€™s building an app, experimenting with AI, or breaking down security systems (the ethical way, of course).
For me, coding isnâ€™t just about solving problems, itâ€™s like a puzzle game that I never get tired of playing. I love the challenge of making things simple, useful, and maybe a little fun along the way.
When Iâ€™m not behind the keyboard, youâ€™ll probably find me exploring new ideas, designing something, or just running to clear my head (yes, literally running).

### What I'm Up To Right Now

* Building: A project that blends machine learning with real-world impact, predicting chronic kidney disease using AI models.
* Learning: Diving deeper into cyber security, zero trust architecture, and advanced ML techniques.
* Collaborating: Open to working on AI/ML and security-related projects, especially those that involve creative problem-solving.
* Creating: Experimenting with UI/UX design and finding new ways to make tech not just functional, but also enjoyable to use.
